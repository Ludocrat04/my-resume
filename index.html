        <p>
            My name is Ole Siegers and I am a 18 year old student at the "Freie Waldorfschule Oldenburg" in Oldenburg, Germany. 
            I am currently doing my high school diploma to be able to study computational neuroscience. My plan is to study cognitive science at the university of Osnabrück for my Bachelor.

            Further I am a passionate gamer and playing in the german esport scene of "League of Legends", additionally I am a great enjoyer of playing different MMOs.
